# Effect of pressure on the drag coefficient of individual bubbles in a contaminated polydisperse swarm
***

This notebook repeats a data analysis that was originally performed in MATLAB.

Work was published in Chemical Engineering Science: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2020.115728 

CHANGES
------

I have recently added a few python scripts to allow those who wish to fit both drag and aspect ratio models using the this data to do so.

It should be noted that this is an indirect way of determining bubble shape which could be far from reality.

The scripts work on my computer, but for some reason I keep catching a few typos on this repo. 

Please bring to my attention any error I have not caught.

Suggestions on how to improve the model are also welcome :)
